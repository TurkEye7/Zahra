House-Help App - Connecting House-Helps with Customers in Kenya
Project Overview
The House-Help App is designed to connect house-helps with customers in Kenya, providing a platform where customers can find reliable house-help services and house-helps can find work opportunities. The app aims to simplify the process of hiring domestic help by offering features such as user registration, profile management, ratings, proximity-based matching, and real-time communication.

Project Goals
Phase 1: Initial Setup
Environment Setup

Install Node.js
Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the Node.js official website.
Install Meteor.js
Install Meteor.js globally by running npm install -g meteor or using the installer from the Meteor website.
Install SQL Database
Choose and install an SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Set up a new database for the app.
Project Initialization

Backend (Node.js)
Run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project.
Install necessary packages: express, sequelize, pg for PostgreSQL, etc.
Frontend (Meteor.js with React)
Create a new Meteor project using meteor create your-app-name.
Install React and other necessary frontend packages.
Phase 2: Backend Development
Database Configuration

Set up Sequelize for database ORM.
Define your models (tables) in Sequelize.
Create migration files to set up your database schema.
Connect Sequelize to your SQL database.
API Development

Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests.
Define RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
Implement authentication (JWT or session-based).
Test API endpoints using tools like Postman.
Phase 3: Frontend Development
Setup Meteor with React

Set up the basic folder structure for React components within the Meteor project.
Create necessary components for your app (e.g., Login, Registration, Dashboard).
Implement state management using Reactâ€™s Context API or a state management library.
Frontend to Backend Integration

Connect the React frontend to the Node.js backend using axios or fetch.
Handle data fetching, form submissions, and other interactions with the backend.
Implement frontend validation and error handling.
Phase 4: User Authentication & Authorization
Implement Authentication

Set up user registration and login systems.
Secure API endpoints using authentication tokens.
Implement role-based access control (if needed).
Protect Frontend Routes

Use React Router for routing.
Protect certain routes based on user authentication status.
Phase 5: Testing
Unit Testing

Write unit tests for backend API endpoints using testing libraries like Jest or Mocha.
Write unit tests for React components.
Integration Testing

Perform integration testing to ensure the frontend and backend work together as expected.
Use tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Phase 6: Deployment
Backend Deployment

Deploy the Node.js backend to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Set up environment variables for database connections and other sensitive information.
Frontend Deployment

Deploy the Meteor.js app using Meteor Galaxy, or any compatible cloud provider.
Configure the frontend to point to the live backend API.
Continuous Integration

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automatic testing and deployment.
Use GitHub Actions or any other CI/CD service.
Phase 7: Maintenance & Iteration
Monitor & Maintain

Set up logging and monitoring for both frontend and backend.
Monitor user feedback and fix any issues that arise.
Feature Expansion

Plan and implement new features based on user feedback.
Continue refining the user experience and app performance.
Next Steps
Backend Implementation:

Start by setting up the database schema and models for User, Profile, and SecondaryContact.
Implement the necessary API endpoints to handle registration and login.
Frontend Setup:

Begin designing the registration interface, focusing on a clean and simple user experience.
